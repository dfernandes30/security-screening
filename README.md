Here's a description of what the code does: 
The code simulates and analyzes an airport passenger processing system by modeling different stages of the airport experience. It starts by generating arrival times for 1000 passengers using a uniform distribution (2-6 minutes between arrivals), then assigns fixed processing times for check-in (5 minutes), gate allocation (3 minutes), and transactions (4 minutes). Security screening times are modeled using a triangular distribution with minimum 4 minutes, most common 8 minutes, and maximum 15 minutes. The code calculates cumulative times as passengers move through each stage and produces comprehensive visualizations including distribution plots with confidence intervals, process completion timelines, box plots comparing different stages, correlation analysis between security and total processing times, and cumulative distribution functions. It also calculates detailed statistical metrics for each process stage, including measures of central tendency (mean, median), variability (standard deviation, coefficient of variation), distribution shape (skewness, kurtosis), and percentile-based statistics (quartiles, 95th and 99th percentiles) to provide insights into the uncertainty and variability of the airport processing system.
